**Course Description**

This course is specifically designed to serve as a broad foundation for students from non-design backgrounds 
to give form to published content. This is a hands-on studio course that will begin with projects that investigate typography, image, composition, sequence, and order, with the aim to design and publish something that demonstrates a point of view by the end of the semester. Woven through the course will be a discussion of contemporary issues that cross design and publishing through an analysis of contemporary books, magazines, and periodicals across both printed and digital platforms.


**Learning Outcomes**

At the end of this course, students will be able to:
– Articulate the historical and contemporary role of design in publishing content in print and online
– Demonstrate comprehensive awareness of design systems, critical thinking, and cultural awareness
– Develop platform-independent design concepts
– Demonstrate basic abilities to form content through typography, image, layout, sequence and order
– Assess and incorporate feedback as part of an iterative design and publishing process
– Offer constructive feedback for others’ work

Some notes. 

1) This class is about synthesis. We will be covering theory, method, concept, and technique in equal proportions.
It is not a skills-training class.   

2) This class will require you to learn how to do a lot of things on your own. In the process, you will learn how to learn on your own, which is more valuable than anything else you learn in this class. You will be asked to do online tutorials and attempt to create things out when it’s not yet proven that you can do it. You’ll do this with help in this class, after which you’ll be able to do anything.

3) You will also document your work and your ideas on a tumblr blog. If you prefer to keep this private so that it is only viewable in this class, you may put it behind a password.

4) Depending on your level of skill and experience, this class will require 3-6 hours of work outside of class. We work in class as well, but not for more than an hour each session. Schedule yourself accordingly.

5) Approach this class in the spirit of experimentation and learning. You may or may not have the chance again to develop and interrogate ideas in a community of like-minded peers. If you merely make work that is “correct,” all you will do is reinforce that notion.
