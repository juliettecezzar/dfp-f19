**Course Description**

This course is specifically designed to serve as a broad foundation for students from non-design backgrounds 
to give form to published content. This is a hands-on studio course that will begin with projects that investigate typography, image, composition, sequence, and order, with the aim to design and publish something that demonstrates a point of view by the end of the semester. Woven through the course will be a discussion of contemporary issues that cross design and publishing through an analysis of contemporary books, magazines, and periodicals across both printed and digital platforms.

– Articulate the historical and contemporary role of design in publishing content in print and online
– Demonstrate comprehensive awareness of design systems, critical thinking, and cultural awareness
– Develop platform-independent design concepts
– Demonstrate basic abilities to form content through typography, image, layout, sequence and order
– Assess and incorporate feedback as part of an iterative design and publishing process
– Offer constructive feedback for others’ work
